# Blockbuster

A visualisation of Hollywood Blockbuster films released between 2007 and 2011.  This is my entry into the [Information is Beautiful Awards Challenge](http://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/2012/01/challenge-of-the-stars/#more-2194).

## Usage

You can search for films using the search input, films can be searched by actors, directors, title, story type, genre and year.

The scatter graph axis can be changed by clicking the axis titles in the top left and bottom right of the graph.

Clicking on a scatter graph circle or film title will bring up a modal window with more details of that film.  From this window you can search for films similar to this film based on budget, gross, profitability etc.

The radar graph in the bottom right corner shows all the films budget, gross, profitability, audience score and number of opening theatres for all the films in the search scope, hovering over it shows the names of the axis.

## Browser Support

Currently this works best in webkit based browsers, Safari, Chrome and Mobile Safari have been tested.  It will work ok in Firefox and Opera however the animation of the scatter graph is _very_ slow buggy, this is a browser issue.
